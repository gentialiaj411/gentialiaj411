## Hi there 👋

# 💫 About Me:
**About Me**<br><br>I'm Genti Aliaj, a sophomore studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University planning on picking up a minor in Artificial Intelligence, with a passion for building systems that bridge hardware and software. <br><br>**What I'm Building**<br><br>I'm drawn to problems at the intersection of low-level programming and real-world applications. I love working on projects where performance and reliability really matter.<br><br>Recently, I built MiniVector, a semantic search platform exploring vector embeddings and retrieval systems, as I'm interested in learning more about how AI operates. At a 24-hour CMU hackathon, my team created an AI storytelling platform with a fine-tuned LLaMA models and real-time text-to-speech with continuous generation. The story does not stop until the user scrolls onto the next one, it can go on for hours and be relevant while interesting. You can find my projects in my repositories.  <br><br>**Beyond the Code**<br><br>When I'm not building projects or working on coursework, you'll find me playing soccer with the CMU Club Soccer team or playing chess with the Chess Club. I'm also fluent in Albanian and Greek (trying to get better at Spanish), and I follow many sports such as soccer, basketball, football, F1, and hockey. <br><br>**What I'm Looking For**<br><br>I'm seeking **Summer 2026 internships** where I can apply my background to real world problems, whether that's in defense, tech, robotics, hardware, financial services, or infrastructure. I'm especially interested in roles that involve:<br>- Low-level systems programming (C/C++)<br>- Embedded firmware development<br>- Hardware-software integration<br>- Performance-critical applications<br>- AI/ML development and infrastructure<br><br>Current Focus<br><br>Right now, I'm diving deep into computer architecture, data structures, and software development while balancing coursework. I'm going to be participating in Build18, CMU's Hardware Hackathon. I will be partnering with 2 students and train an AI straight off of an FPGA. It will be challenging, but I know we will achieve our goal. <br><br>Let's Connect<br><br>I'm always interested in chatting about anything whether it be technology, sports, or even chess. Feel free to reach out:<br><br>- Email: galiaj@andrew.cmu.edu<br>- GitHub: https://github.com/gentialiaj411<br>- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/gentialiaj/<br><br>If you're working on something cool , I'd love to hear about it.
